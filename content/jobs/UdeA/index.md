- **Research focus:** My undergraduate studies focused on two different areas: the study of the two-photon absorption coefficient in semiconductor materials and the study of open quantum systems.
- **Selected publications:**
  - [Correspondence Between the Energy Equipartition Theorem in Classical Mechanics and its Phase-Space Formulation in Quantum Mechanics](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/25/6/939) _Entropy_ 25(6), 939.
  - [Measuring semiconductors two-photon absorption with a technique based on laser power variations](https://opa.sedoptica.es/en/article/1602) _Óptica Pura y Aplicada_ 55(4), 50020.
- **Preprints:**
  - [Experimental parameters’ uncertainty limits for z-scan and f-scan techniques](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15065)
  - [Influence of initial entangled states on the temperature-dependent CHSH inequality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07455)
