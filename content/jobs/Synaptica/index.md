- Built and productionized a statistical anomaly detection system for bank accounts, integrated into a Streamlit platform; automated ingestion → feature engineering → scoring → alert generation with backtesting, threshold tuning, and monitoring.
- Developed a resilient web data extraction pipeline using Python + Selenium, implementing session management, rate limiting, retries, and validation; handled access challenges via a compliant captcha-handling workflow and robust fallbacks to ensure stable data delivery.
- Fine-tuned Transformer-based NLP classifiers in PyTorch to map free-text descriptions into predefined labels; built the full training/evaluation loop (splits, metrics, error analysis) and packaged inference for integration into downstream automation.
- Developed a Python data-quality monitoring application (PyQt) with CI/CD practices in Azure DevOps, running automated integrity checks (schema drift, missingness, duplicates, outliers) and triggering actionable anomaly alerts with traceable logs.
- Delivered an end-to-end ML pipeline and Streamlit app for construction budgets: ingestion and normalization, feature generation, area-based model training, engineering rule application, and automated quantity prediction with versioned outputs.
- Automated standardization of construction budgets from heterogeneous Excel/Word templates into analytics-ready datasets using robust parsing, normalization rules, and validation checks; enabled consistent downstream reporting and model training.
- Created a reusable Cookiecutter ETL template in Python to standardize new data pipelines (config-driven structure, logging, testing hooks, and consistent project layout), accelerating delivery and improving maintainability across projects.
